# Upstream watches

<!-- cspell:ignore Packagist -->

One file per upstream issue or pull request this repository is waiting on. The `watch-upstream` workflow (`.github/workflows/watch-upstream.yml`) reads every `*.json` file here once a day and comments on the row's tracking issue when something moves. This README is also what keeps the directory tracked while it holds no rows, which is a valid state: the workflow then has nothing to do.

## Row format

Name the file `<tracker>-<owner>-<repo>-<number>.json`, for example `412-laravel-framework-58123.json` for tracker `412` watching `laravel/framework#58123` (`/` in the repository becomes `-`). The loader rejects a file whose name does not match its contents, so the name is always unique and says what it watches.

```json
{ "tracker": 412, "repo": "laravel/framework", "kind": "pr", "number": 58123, "composer": "laravel/framework", "released": true }
```

| Key | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tracker` | yes | Issue number in this repository that receives the comments. Closing it turns the watch off. |
| `repo` | yes | The upstream repository, `owner/name`. |
| `kind` | yes | `issue` or `pr`. |
| `number` | yes | The upstream issue or pull request number. |
| `composer` | no | A `vendor/package` name. Adds a signal for a Packagist release newer than the version in `composer.lock`. |
| `released` | no | `true` on a `pr` row only. Adds a signal for the first release on the pull request's base-branch line that contains the merge commit. |

Unknown keys, a missing key and a wrong type fail the run with the file named, so a malformed row is never silently skipped.

## Adding and retiring a row

- **Add** a row in the same pull request that adds the local patch it exists for, so the patch and its removal trigger land together.
- **Retire** a row in the pull request that drops the patch: delete the file and close the tracking issue. Closing the tracker alone stops the comments; deleting the file stops the workflow reading it.
- Two rows under one tracker share an off switch, so give threads separate trackers whenever either can outlive the other.

## Notes on current rows


- `2-pestphp-pest-1763.json`: `pestphp/pest#1763`, an open report that test file order affects the reliability of later browser tests, related to the hardcoded per-attempt timeout the per-attempt timeout patch works around. When it closes, check whether the fix removes the need for that patch (`UAMS-Web/patches-pest-plugin-browser#2`).
- `3-pestphp-pest-1754.json`: `pestphp/pest#1754`, the open report that `playwright run-server` is never killed where `/bin/sh` is dash, which the no-shell server patch works around. When it closes, check whether the fix removes the need for that patch (`UAMS-Web/patches-pest-plugin-browser#3`).

No row carries `composer`: the workflow reads the pin from `composer.lock`, and this package is a library that commits none (it pins `pestphp/pest-plugin-browser` in `composer.json`), so the Packagist signal would fail the run rather than report.
